    "> - Source with a link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanakku/ai-workforce-and-automation-dataset-20152025\n",
    "> - Fields: Country, Year, AI Investment (% of GDP), Automation Rate (% of jobs), Employment Rate (% of population), Average Annual Wage, Jobs Created, Jobs Displaced, Reskilling Investment, AI Readiness Index, Productivity Change\n",

    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set? I chose this dataset because it provides a realistic picture of how artificial intelligence impacts global labor markets. It captures economic and social effects from rising productivity to workforce displacement making it ideal for statistical analysis and visual storytelling about the balance between automation and human employment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - How does increased AI investment correlate with automation rates across countries and years?\n",
    "> - Does a higher automation rate correspond to lower employment rates?\n",
    "> - Is there evidence that higher reskilling investments lead to more job creation and less displacement?\n",
    "> - Which countries are leading in AI readiness, and how does that relate to productivity and employment stability?\n",
    "> - How have automation rates and employment levels evolved globally over the decade?\n",

    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
